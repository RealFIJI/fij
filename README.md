You may use Fij on your Discord server by using [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=768995826604179517&permissions=8&scope=bot) and inviting Fij to your server.

If you would like to test beta versions of Fij, you may use [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=838321066530308126&permissions=8&scope=bot) to invite Fij Beta to your server. (I would not reccomend doing this in a big server, as it may be unstable.)
